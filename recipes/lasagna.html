    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="https://thecozycook.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Lasagna-Recipe-f.jpg" height="300" alt="picture of lasagna">
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with a rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and cheese. The heart of the dish lies in the meat sauce, often a Bolognese-style sauce made with ground beef or pork, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and herbs like oregano and basil. This sauce simmers for hours to develop deep, savory flavors. Alongside it, a smooth béchamel sauce, made from butter, flour, and milk, adds creaminess, creating a beautiful contrast to the hearty meat.</p>
    <p>To assemble the lasagna, the pasta sheets are layered alternately with the meat sauce, béchamel, and generous amounts of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. The dish is baked until the top is golden and bubbling, and the layers are melded together in a comforting, savory blend. The result is a warm, cheesy, and deeply satisfying meal that’s perfect for family gatherings or special occasions, offering a combination of flavors and textures in every bite.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the meat sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef or pork</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the béchamel sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>4 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>Pinch of nutmeg</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For assembling the lasagna:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna sheets (pre-cooked or no-boil)</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1 cup Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        <li>Fresh basil (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute. Then, add the ground beef or pork and cook until browned, breaking it up as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for 20-30 minutes to develop the flavors.</li>
        <li>While the meat sauce is simmering, prepare the béchamel sauce. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes until it forms a roux.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the milk while whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Cook the sauce, stirring constantly, until it thickens, about 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and a pinch of nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the dish. Place a layer of lasagna sheets on top.</li>
        <li>Spoon more meat sauce over the lasagna sheets, then add a layer of béchamel sauce. Sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layering process until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a final layer of béchamel and cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil if desired, and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
