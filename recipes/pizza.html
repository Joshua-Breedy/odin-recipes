    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For a classic Margherita pizza, start with a simple dough made from all-purpose flour, water, yeast, salt, and a drizzle of olive oil. Mix the ingredients until they form a smooth, elastic dough, then let it rise for about an hour. While the dough rests, prepare a fresh tomato sauce by simmering crushed tomatoes with garlic, olive oil, and a pinch of salt. Once the dough has doubled in size, stretch it into a thin, round shape, keeping the edges slightly thicker for a perfect crust.</p>
    <p>Preheat your oven to its highest setting, ideally 500°F (260°C), and set a pizza stone or baking sheet inside to heat up. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Tear fresh mozzarella into chunks and scatter them on top, followed by fresh basil leaves and a light drizzle of olive oil. Bake the pizza for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and crispy, and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned. Once out of the oven, finish it off with a sprinkle of sea salt and more fresh basil if desired. Slice and enjoy!</p>

        <li>8 oz fresh mozzarella, torn into chunks</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Olive oil (for drizzling)</li>
        <li>Sea salt (optional, for finishing)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour, warm water, yeast, salt, and olive oil until a smooth, elastic dough forms.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and let it rise for about an hour, or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>While the dough rises, prepare the tomato sauce by simmering crushed tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and salt in a small saucepan for about 10-15 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C), placing a pizza stone or baking sheet inside to heat up.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, stretch the dough into a thin, round shape, leaving the edges slightly thicker for a nice crust.</li>
        <li>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Tear the fresh mozzarella into chunks and distribute them evenly on the pizza.</li>
        <li>Top with fresh basil leaves and drizzle a small amount of olive oil over the pizza.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and, if desired, sprinkle with a little sea salt and add more fresh basil for garnish.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve hot. Enjoy your homemade Margherita pizza!</li>
