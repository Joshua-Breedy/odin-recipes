    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken, also known as "murgh makhani," is a rich and flavorful North Indian dish. It begins with marinated chicken, typically coated in yogurt, lemon juice, and a blend of spices such as garam masala, turmeric, cumin, and chili powder. The marinated chicken is traditionally cooked in a tandoor (a clay oven), but it can also be grilled or pan-seared until lightly charred and tender. The sauce, made from a base of tomatoes, butter, cream, and spices, is simmered until it becomes silky and aromatic, creating the dish’s signature creamy texture and vibrant orange hue.</p>
    <p>Once the chicken is added to the sauce, it absorbs all the luxurious flavors. The butter, along with a splash of cream, adds a smooth, velvety richness that perfectly complements the spice blend. The final touch often includes a sprinkle of fenugreek leaves for a subtle, earthy flavor and fresh cilantro for brightness. Butter chicken is commonly served with steamed basmati rice or warm naan bread, making it the ultimate comfort food, satisfying with every bite.</p>

        <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger (minced)</li>
        <li>400g canned crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tbsp dried fenugreek leaves (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the chicken, yogurt, lemon juice, garam masala, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, and salt. Mix well and let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight for best results).</li>
        <li>Heat a large pan or grill over medium heat. Add a little oil and cook the marinated chicken until lightly charred and cooked through. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add butter and a tablespoon of oil. Sauté the chopped onions until golden and softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, garam masala, cumin, coriander, chili powder, and salt. Let the sauce simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked chicken to the sauce and mix well to coat the chicken in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Pour in the heavy cream and dried fenugreek leaves (if using), and stir until the sauce is creamy and smooth.</li>
        <li>Simmer for another 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve hot with basmati rice or naan bread.</li>
    </ol>
